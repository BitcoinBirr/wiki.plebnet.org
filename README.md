### CheeseRobot â‚¿

A Telegram bot that will allow you to join and interact with the PLEBNET. 

You'll want to send a message to `@cheeserobot` to claim and add your node. Start with `/claim` and follow the instructions to get add your node id. Then, in the PLEBNET channel, use `/id@cheeserobot` to get yourself added to the graph.

## Opening Channels

### Add Liquidity

Generate a Lightning wallet and add some funds so that you can open channels. Keep in mind that PLEBNET prefers girthy channels.

### Find nodes in PLEBNET Telegram group

You'll need to find some other nodes in PLEBNET to open channels with.

Typing `/groupnodes@cheeserobot` will output a list of the 50 most recent members and nodes. `/graph@cheeserobot group` will generate and show a visual graph of all of the connected nodes in PLEBNET. You can contact plebs on this list and see if they'd like to open a channel.

You can also just ask in the PLEBNET channel if anyone is interested in opening a channel with you.

### Keep It Girthy

It's best to have fewer big channels with more sats than it is to have many smaller ones. The recommended minimum channel size is 2 million, which would be 1 million per user on the channel.
